# FEMU - FIO IOUring Result
This repository will show the result of the new configuration of FIO  Benchmarking using FEMU on cloudlabs, it will contains : 
- BW Benchmarking (Including Sequential Read and Write)
- IOPS Benchmarking (Including Sequential Read and Write, Random Read and Write)

As far this benchmarking is running i've been used Ubuntu 20.04 focal fosa with kernel linux 5.4.0 ``FIO Version 3.1.6`` and FEMU on ``run-nossd.sh`` configuration. For the hardware system i've been using Intel Xeon Silver 4114 with 10 cores and 20 threads. 

For the result of benchmarking i've been made a seperate folder for write and read bandwidth result, to make it easy to understand the result, here for quick access : <br>
